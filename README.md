# Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, a supervised binary (positive or negative) sentiment classification analysis is done using customer review data from Amazon.com. We demonstrate the efficiency of several data pre-processing strategies by enhancing categorization. Additionally, we contrast three machine learning models: the linear support vector classification model (LinearSVC), the logistic regression model (LogisticRegression), and the multinomial Naive Bayes classification model (MultinomialNB).  

The analysis's findings indicate that improving data preprocessing by incorporating negation handling and n-gram modelling techniques can greatly improve model accuracy. The outcome also shows that the SVC model offers the highest level of prediction accuracy.
